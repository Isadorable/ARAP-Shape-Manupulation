# ARAP-Shape-Manupulation

The aim of this code is to explore interactive surface-based deformation through the
implementation of the "As-Rigid-As-Possible Shape Manipulation" algorithm 
[IGARASHI, Takeo ; MOSCOVICH, Tomer ; HUGHES, John F.: As-rigid-as-possible
ShapeManipulation] described
in detail in the more recent paper Implementing "As-Rigid-As-Possible Shape Manipulation
and Surface Flattening". The algorithm was tested on a given 2D triangular
mesh, often used to demonstrate the potential of this method.
